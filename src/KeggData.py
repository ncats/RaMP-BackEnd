This module works to import a variety of data about metabolites from the kegg database.

    KeggData's functions work together to get all required information from the kegg database. 
    
    
    This class contains six functions:
    
        - 1) getPathways()
        - 2) getMetabolites()
        - 3) getSynonyms()
        - 4) getGenes()
        - 5) getGeneInfo()
        - 6) writeToFiles()
        
    These functions must be called in the order listed to work correctly as each consecutive function relies on the previous function(s).
